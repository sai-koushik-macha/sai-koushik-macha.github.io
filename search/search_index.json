There are better methods for moving the cursor in a current line. But right now we could use w to move cursor by word forward. In same way we could use b to move cursor by word backword. Writing The Text In other text editors for writing text we directly start typing. In vim we can't type directly because in vim we will be in normal mode by default. To start typing inside vim we should go inside insert mode. There are many methods for doing it but the simple method is by pressing i . Now we can start typing like in normal editors. After we completed typing we should back to normal by pressing key. Visual mode Small v In vim we could highlight the text by using visual mode. To go into visual mode use v keybinding. After entering visual mode we could highlight more text by moving cursor i.e. use normal mode movements i.e., h,j,k,l and so on. Capital V Highlighting text by using above method is good but if we want highlight many lines then using capital V would be great option. we could leave visual mode and go to normal mode just pressing key. Copy And Paste Copying Use visual mode to highlight the text that we want to copy. After that press y letter to copy the vim register and we automatically go to normal mode. In vim copy is called yank. Pasting Go to the place where you want to paste the text and press p it will paste the text from the vim register. By default you can't paste the text from outside of vim to inside of vim vice versa. Delete The Text In the same way as yanking we could select or highlight the text that we want remove. After that to delete the text by pressing d Saving And Exiting The File Saving The File To save the file we should make sure that we are in normal mode. Press :w where colon means that we are entering command mode and w means we are writing to the file. Exiting the Vim To exit the vim press :q where q means quit.","title":"Vim Basics"},{"location":"vim/vim-basics/#vim-basics","text":"","title":"Vim Basics"},{"location":"vim/vim-basics/#basic-movements","text":"","title":"Basic Movements"},{"location":"vim/vim-basics/#side-movements","text":"h - move left j - move down k - move up l - move right","title":"Side Movements"},{"location":"vim/vim-basics/#moving-by-words","text":"Moving the cursor by charter can take long time i.e. using h and l to move cursor in a current line.
